# Stone Breaker Game

A beautiful physics-based web game where you break randomly shaped blocks that split into smaller fragments when clicked.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click on the floating blocks to break them
3. Each block has a unique random shape (rectangle, triangle, hexagon, L-shape, trapezoid)
4. Large blocks break into medium blocks, medium blocks break into small blocks
5. Score more points for breaking smaller blocks - large blocks give 10 points, medium blocks 20 points, and small blocks 30 points
6. Enjoy the dynamic particle effects with realistic block fragments!
